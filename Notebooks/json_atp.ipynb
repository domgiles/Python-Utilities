    "This workbook is divided into two sections the first is a quick guide to setting up Jupyter Lab (Python Notebooks) such that it can connect to a database running inside of OCI, in this case an ATP instance. The second section uses the JSON python driver to connect to the database to run a few tests. This notebook is largely a reminder to myself on how to set this up but hopefully it will be useful to others.\n",
    "#### Setting up Python 3.6 and Jupyter Lab on our compute instance\n",
    "I won't go into much detail on setting up ATP or ADW or creating a IaaS server. I covered that process in quite a lot of detail [here](http://www.dominicgiles.com/blog/files/c84a63640d52961fc28f750570888cdc-169.html). We'll be setting up something similar to the following\n",

    "In the following steps we'll be using python so we need to set up python on the server and configure the needed modules. Our first step is to use yum to install python 3.6 (This is personal preference and you could stick with python 2.7). To do this we first need to enable yum and then install the environment. Run the following commands\n",
